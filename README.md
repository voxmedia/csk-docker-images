# csk-docker-images

This repo contains the source for docker images used by the Custom Storytelling Kit.

## Publishing Updates

If you update an image, please ensure you update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes, and bump the VERSION accordingly. Pushing to master will automatically push a new image via [the github workflow](https://github.com/voxmedia/csk-docker-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-build-and-push.yml).
